# Code-Alpha-Internship-Tasks

## Overview

This repository contains my submission for the Python internship at Code Alpha. I have completed 3 out of 4 tasks assigned for the internship. Each task demonstrates my skills and passion for robotics, and how I applied Python programming to solve a real problem  that i'm facing

## Tasks Completed

1. Hangman Game: I have implemented a text-based Hangman game using Python. While this task does not directly relate to robotics, it showcases my proficiency in Python programming and problem-solving skills.

2. Basic Chatbot: I have created a text-based chatbot that engages in conversations about robotics. This task allowed me to link my passion for robotics with Python programming by implementing a chatbot that discusses various topics related to robotics.

3. Email Filtering: One of the tasks involved automating the separation of emails from my supervisor and other emails. I applied Python scripting to automate this process, which is a common problem in real-world scenarios. This task demonstrates my ability to apply Python skills to solve practical problems, as well as my understanding of email filtering techniques.

## Remaining Task

Unfortunately, I was unable to complete the fourth task within the given timeframe. However, I am committed to continuing my learning journey and further developing my skills in Python programming and robotics.
